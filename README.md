# Debunk Cloud Native Patterns in Go

As always, after some times, and some success at launching
[Cloud Native](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/DEFINITION.md) products
engineers identified some patterns.
These patterns can seem hard to grasp the first time,
but I hope examples of this project will help you to understand them
and when and how to use them.

A huge part of this content was inspired by the book
[Cloud Native Go](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/cloud-native-go/9781492076322/)
by [Matthew A. Titmus](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-titmus/)
